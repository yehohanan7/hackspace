# Hackspace

A command line interface to popular cloud APIs.

## Usage

./setup.sh -> will install all required jars into your local maven repo
./build.sh -> will build hackspace executable jar

./hs init
   this command will initialize the local hackspace environment by fetching the access-key/token from the cloud store,
   this command will also generate a url which you need to access in the browser and authorize hackspace to access your dropbox details.
   once you are done authorizing, type 'yes' in the command prompt and press enter to complete initialization.

   Note: In future versions, the manual authorization will be removed.

./hs -stats
   Fetches the statistics of your cloud store usage.

./hs -ls
   displays the folders and the corresponding sizes in your root drop box directory

   example:
   /books                  :0 bytes
   /Uploads                :0 bytes
   /Sample.pdf             :240.2 KB
   /ml                     :0 bytes
   /Photos                 :0 bytes
   /Public                 :0 bytes

./hs -ls books
    displays all the files with corresponding sizes present in the directory named 'books'

   example output:
